model header (0x10 size)
+ 0 [][][][] number of parts
+ 8 [][][][] store some address here


parts header
+00 [][]     init flags
             0x0001 - memory +18 (for polygon normals for lighting) allocated.
             0x0002 - polygon normals for lighting are calculated and stored.
             0x0010 - if flag is set we create copy of vertexes +0c in some cases.
+02 [][]     number of vertexes.
+04 [][]     number of polygons.
+06 [][]     number of polygons blocks.
+08 [][][][] offset to vertex block.
+0c [][][][] offset to some other vectors block used in gourad shaded poly, maybe normals.
+10 [][][][] offset to mesh block.
+14 [][][][] offset to texture coords block.
+18 [][][][] we store here pointer to allocated memory for normals for polygons lighting with +30 size if +00 & 1 not set.
+1c [][][][] some offset (if exist).
+20 [][]     x1.

+2a [][]     y2.
+2—Å [][]     z2.
+30 [][][][] memory size for polygon normals for lighting.
+34 [][][][] allocate twice as much place. Maybe size of all packets (twice because threre are 2 frames one to display and one to render).
