Walkmesh Surface Flags
Here are the walkmesh flags and their likely meanings based on the source code:

Simple Property Flags
These flags generally represent a single, binary (on/off) property.
Flag values can be combined to combine properties on a walkmesh surface.

0x00000100 (SLOW): This flag reduces the character's movement speed by halve.

0x00020000 (AUTOSLIDE): Player slides down a slope while still having control, not as steep.

0x00080000 (LADDER): Allows the character to climb up or down.

0x00100000 (NO_SHADOW): The character's sprite shadow is not rendered when on a triangle with this flag.

0x00200000 (SWIM): Sets player to swim animation (used for Bart)

0x00800000 (OOB): All characters cannot enter a triangle with this flag set. Out of bounds areas.

0x04000000 (CAM_RAMP): This flag is used by the camera logic to smoothly adjust its height as the player moves up or down in certain areas.

0x40000000 (NO_JUMP): Prevents the player from initiating a jump while on this surface.

Multi-bit and Combined Flags
These flags are read as multi-bit values or are used in combination to define more nuanced behaviors.

Environmental Movement (Conveyor Belts / Wind)
These flags work together to push the character in a specific direction at a specific speed. This is handled in the updateEntityEventCode2 function.

0x00000600 (SPEED): Bits 9 and 10 are read as a 2-bit value (0 to 3) that sets the speed of the environmental push.

0x00003800 (DIRECTION): Bits 11, 12, and 13 are read as a 3-bit value (0 to 7) that sets the direction of the push.

0x00400000 (WALL_SLOPE): Bit 22 must be set for the environmental movement to be active at all. Disables player control and forces them to slide off, usually set on steep slopes where player would fall/slide down until they touch the ground.

Combined Flags
Flags can be combined to set multiple properties at once like:
0x40400000: This would make it so the player couldn't jump from this surface

Entity Permissions
These flags are used to define which types of entities are allowed to be on a surface. This is checked in the updateEntityEventCode3Sub0 function.

0x00000020 (Bit 5): (NPC_STOP): Permission flag for entity type 1.

0x00000040 (Bit 6): (FOLLOWER_STOP): Permission flag for entity type 2.

0x00000080 (Bit 7): (PC_STOP): Permission flag for entity type 3.
