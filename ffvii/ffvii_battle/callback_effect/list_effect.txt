            create 4 effects 0x800d3bf0 (one dust cloud) in position of joints 0xb,0xc,0xb,0xc. One effect by frame.

0x800d7368 (machinegun shell)
            load 3d data for shell effect and move it by setted direction every frame. When position reach ground we create effect 0x800d3af0 at this place and set it to fall down again (with random direction). When it falls down again we create effect 0x800d3af0 at this place and stop this effect.
